# Nyaa.si Auto Downloader

A simple script to automate checking for new episodes of animes,
adding them to transmission-daemon, and managing completed downloads.

Add it to cron or similar service to run automatically.

Note that the script looks for config.json at the working directory,
so change to the directory that contains the config.json file before
running the script.
